I have the rather enjoyable task of setting up a brand new work computer for the first time in about seven years. 

I've accumulated a lot of tools and customizations on my current development machine; getting all of that set up on the new box is going to take some time. Which made me consider: what are the absolute esssential tools I need to get installed in order to feel happy and productive?

Choice of tools is, of course, a matter of personal preference depending on the kind of workflow you use. Here are my choices for the things I would not want to live without:

<h3 class="cat1">Must haves</h3>
There are a few top-priority items that I am going to install immediately.

### *The latest Windows 10 Insider Build*

I have always been an aggressive self-hoster of new Windows builds ever since I started as a membere of the 'Windows NT 5' team, as it was known at the time. (One of the rare Windows development releases that [did not have a codename](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Microsoft_codenames).)

These days, the [Windows Insider Program](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/) is the best way to stay on top of all the great new changes that are making Windows 10 better all the time.

#### How to get it:
Assuming you already are running Windows 10 you simply need to opt-in to the Windows Insider program. Just look for the ninja-cat item in the main Settings page.

It looks like this:

Once you are opted-in to the program you can choose a few options, such as how often to get new builds. I'm in the 'fast' ring because that's just more fun.

### *Windows Terminal Preview*

Once I get rolling using the new computer I am going to be spending a lot of time, perhaps the majority of my time, working on the command-line. I'm a Windows command-line junkie and have been for years. 

The new [Windows Terminal](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/introducing-windows-terminal/) is an amazing addition to the command-line story for Windows. If you're a Windows user and don't have it you are missing out. Yes, it still has some bugs that need to be worked out, but it's such a productivity booster even with the current issues that I can't live without it.

### *Cascadia Code Font Family*

Not only did the Windows Terminal team bring us the awesome new terminal itself, they also have produced an absolutely *gorgeous* mono-spaced font family called [Cascadia](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/cascadia-code/).

I'm not a big fan of code ligatures so I currently use the Cascadia Mono variant, which omits the ligatures.

I like this font so much it's both my default terminal font and my primary programming font.

There's even a version that supports [Powerline symbols](https://github.com/ryanoasis/powerline-extra-symbols)!

### *Visual Studio Code*
<img src="/images/vscode1.png" style="width:50%; height:50%;float:right;padding:10px"/>
For my main day-job I do C# programming and as a result my primary development environment is Visual Studio. I'll get that installed on the new computer eventually, but while I'm getting things set up I am definitely going to want something I use for editing my PowerShell profile, tweaking scripts, editing my Windows Terminal setttings, etc.

For that kind of thing [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my go-to editor. I find the VSCode experience to be great, it's very aesthetically pleasing (much more so than Visual Studio in my opinion) and the plugin infrastructure works great.

I also use it for my non-C# programming and for writing these blog posts.

Throw in the fact that it's cross-platform and it's no wonder that it has really taken off in popularity.

Highly recommended if you aren't already a die-hard Vim or Emacs user.

I think that wraps up the initial 'must have' list for my new development workstation.

We're just getting started, though. Once I have the above installed there will still be a lot more work to be done before I will truly able to code with joy.

We'll cover some of the remaining tools in an upcoming post.
