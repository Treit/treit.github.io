## Chocolatey Package Manager
Package managers have increasingly become the favored way of finding, installing and updating all manner of software.

If you are a Linux user you will certainly be familiar with [apt-get](https://linux.die.net/man/8/apt-get), the command-line tool for performing package management.

If you are a javascript programmer, you will almost certainly have used [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), the package manager for javascript packages. Python programmers use [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) or [Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), while .NET programmers use [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/).

There are many more.

On Windows, somewhat filling the role that apt-get plays on Linux, there is [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org).

Chocolatey lets us install software easily from the command line, an ideal choice for the PowerShell-based Windows Terminal environment that I spend most of my time in.

After following the instructions on the [install page](https://chocolatey.org/install) above, we are ready to install a variety of Windows packages from the command-line.
